/*Write a class with the name ComplexNumber. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name real and imaginary of type double. It represents the Complex Number.
The class needs to have one constructor. The constructor has parameters real and imaginary of type double and it needs to initialize the fields.
Write the following methods (instance methods):
Method named getReal without any parameters, it needs to return the value of real field.
Method named getImaginary without any parameters, it needs to return the value of imaginary field.
Method named add with two parameters real and imaginary of type double, it needs to add parameters to fields. In other words, it needs to do a complex number add operation as described above.
Method named add with one parameter of type ComplexNumber. It needs to add the ComplexNumber parameter to the corresponding instance variables.
Method named subtract with two parameters real and imaginary of type double, it needs to subtract parameters from fields, in other words, it needs to do a complex number subtract operation as described above.
Method named subtract with one parameter of type ComplexNumber. It needs to subtract the other parameter from this complex number.*/
